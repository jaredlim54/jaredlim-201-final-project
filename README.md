## Domain of Interest

We plan on working with Nintendo's data over the past few years and analyzing sales or other measurable data. As we all play video games and have experience with Nintendo products/devices, we wanted to work with this because it's close to us. Since we have experience with it and has an impact on our hobbies, it is overall an interesting topic for us to analyze.

[This project](https://www.one37pm.com/culture/trading-cards/pokemon-cards-selling-investing) about the recent rise in Pokémon cards prices. It is related to Nintendo as Nintendo ignited the initial popularity rise of early Pokémon games and cards. With data and analysis on, why card prices are rising, how to determine the rarity of a certain card, and more on Pokémon cards, this data project has provided with us a idea on how to begin our project on the analysis of Nintendo.

[This project](https://www.kaggle.com/jessemostipak/animal-crossing) analyzes the user reviews of Animal Crossing, a game released by Nintendo in March. This project moreover shows that Nintendo is a large company where we can analyze some of their specific products and analyze its data.

[This project](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/05/12/video-game-industry-coronavirus/) analyzes the rise in popularity of gaming during the pandemic of COVID-19. Researchers from Microsoft and Nintendo both observed rises in purchases in products and games. This shows that Nintendo is a large cooperate, which allows us to analyze why specifically their games, products, and their represented data is the way it is.


Some data driven questions we hope to answer include:
- What region is a certain Nintendo product/game most popular?
  - We could answer this by looking at datasets of Nintendo sales in different regions and figuring out what their most popular game is across each region.
- What was the product with the most and least sales?
  - We could answer this by looking at Nintendo products that have the most/least revenue from an imported dataset.
- How does each region compare in terms of product sales?
  - We could compare the datasets of Nintendo sales from different regions and analyzing what their differences are.


## Finding Data
[Video Games Dataset](https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/what-makes-a-blockbuster-video-game(a6d848fe-38ae-4584-8c95-a0f735ec9b4c).html))
- This dataset was collected by Dr Joe Crox from University of Portsmouth. It contains study of individual video game titles and the sales made in the US.
- It has 1771 rows and 166 columns. Some features on the columns are year of each game released, US sales, genre of the game, price of each game, publisher, console and much more.
- It can answer the Nintendo games sales revenue in the US region. The most and least popular Nintendo games sold in the US by year.


[Video Game Sales](https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales)
- This dataset contains a list of video game sales with sales that are more than 100,000 copies.
- It has 11493 rows, 11 columns. Contains various columns of information such as the platform of the game, the year, and the sales in different regions.
- It can answer how each region compares in terms of sales and what products of Nintendo were the most popular globally.

[Nintendo Sales Transition by Regions](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/library/historical_data/pdf/consolidated_sales_e1603.pdf)
- This dataset contains list of video game sales from all the world, regardless of it being downloaded or purchased, with sales in units per 10,000 copies.
- This data set has 63 columns and 61 rows, the reason for this is that much of the values and data in these rows and columns are compacted, so there is more than one value piece in each section. The columns represent the amount of copies per 10,000 while, the rows represent the specific product, and the location of where the product was purchased throughout the world.
- This dataset can help answer the question of what region is a certain product more popular and the question of what products of Nintendo are most popular when comparing it globally.
